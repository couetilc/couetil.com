Go server powering the home page for my domain, [couetil.com](https://www.couetil.com).

TODO
- Dockerize this, so I can deploy an image on AWS Lambda. Resume will be a distinct build stage I pull the final files from.


NOTE
- checkout `http/httptrace`, `http/httputil`, and `http/pprof` for robust web server. See what exactly they are used for.
